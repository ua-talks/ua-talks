# Welcome to Bridgetown!
#
# This config file is for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that.
#
# A list of all available configuration options can be found here:
# https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/configuration/options
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# `bin/bridgetown start`. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# For reloadable site metadata like title, SEO description, social media
# handles, etc., take a look at `src/_data/site_metadata.yml`

# Other options you might want to investigate:
#
# base_path: "/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog. If you set this option,
# ensure you use the `relative_url` helper for all links and assets in your HTML.
# If you're using esbuild for frontend assets, edit `esbuild.config.js` to
# update `publicPath`.
